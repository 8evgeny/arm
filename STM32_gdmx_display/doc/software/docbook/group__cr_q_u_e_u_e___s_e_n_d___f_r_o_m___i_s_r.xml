<para>The macro&apos;s crQUEUE_SEND_FROM_ISR() and crQUEUE_RECEIVE_FROM_ISR() are the co-routine equivalent to the xQueueSendFromISR() and xQueueReceiveFromISR() functions used by tasks.</para>

<para>crQUEUE_SEND_FROM_ISR() and crQUEUE_RECEIVE_FROM_ISR() can only be used to pass data between a co-routine and and ISR, whereas xQueueSendFromISR() and xQueueReceiveFromISR() can only be used to pass data between a task and and ISR.</para>

<para>crQUEUE_SEND_FROM_ISR can only be called from an ISR to send data to a queue that is being used from within a co-routine.</para>

<para>See the co-routine section of the WEB documentation for information on passing data between tasks and co-routines and between ISR&apos;s and co-routines.</para>
