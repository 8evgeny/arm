<para>A version of xQueuePeek() that can be called from an interrupt service routine (ISR).</para>

<para>Receive an item from a queue without removing the item from the queue. The item is received by copy so a buffer of adequate size must be provided. The number of bytes copied into the buffer was defined when the queue was created.</para>

<para>Successfully received items remain on the queue so will be returned again by the next call, or a call to xQueueReceive().</para>
