xSemaphoreGive( SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphore )
.fi
.PP
.PP
\fIMacro\fP to release a semaphore\&. The semaphore must have previously been created with a call to xSemaphoreCreateBinary(), xSemaphoreCreateMutex() or xSemaphoreCreateCounting()\&. and obtained using sSemaphoreTake()\&.
.PP
This macro must not be used from an ISR\&. See xSemaphoreGiveFromISR () for an alternative which can be used from an ISR\&.
.PP
This macro must also not be used on semaphores created using xSemaphoreCreateRecursiveMutex()\&.
.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIxSemaphore\fP A handle to the semaphore being released\&. This is the handle returned when the semaphore was created\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
pdTRUE if the semaphore was released\&. pdFALSE if an error occurred\&. Semaphores are implemented using queues\&. An error can occur if there is no space on the queue to post a message - indicating that the semaphore was not first obtained correctly\&.

Example usage: 
.PP
.nf

SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphore = NULL;

void vATask( void * pvParameters )

   // Create the semaphore to guard a shared resource\&.

       if( xSemaphoreGive( xSemaphore ) != pdTRUE )
       {
           // We would expect this call to fail because we cannot give
           // a semaphore without first 'taking' it!
       }

       // Obtain the semaphore - don't block if the semaphore is not
       // immediately available\&.
       if( xSemaphoreTake( xSemaphore, ( TickType_t ) 0 ) )
       {
           // We now have the semaphore and can access the shared resource\&.

           // \&.\&.\&.

           // We have finished accessing the shared resource so can free the
           // semaphore\&.
           if( xSemaphoreGive( xSemaphore ) != pdTRUE )
           {
               // We would not expect this call to fail because we must have
               // obtained the semaphore to get here\&.
           }
